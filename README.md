This repository tracks the flight booker assignment from [The Odin Project's curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms). The motive behind this project is to obtain experience working with advanced forms in Rails. The site features a one-way flight booker that allows users to search for flights, choose their desired flight from a list of options, and enter their passenger information.
